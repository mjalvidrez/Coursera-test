            It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. 
            You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

            I am old, Gandalf. 
            I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. 
            Well-preserved indeed! 
            Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. 
            That can't be right. I need a change, or something.

            One Ring to rule them all, 
            One Ring to find them, 
            One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
